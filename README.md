# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project implements a simple movie recommendation system using various techniques including Numpy, Pandas, Difflib, TF-IDF Vectorizer, and Cosine Similarity. The system suggests movies based on user input or a selected movie, finding similarities in movie descriptions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
2. pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
3. python main.py

# Dependencies
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and working with arrays.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Used for TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity calculation.
Difflib: Used for text similarity comparison.

# How it Works
The movie recommendation system uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity between movies based on their descriptions. User input or a selected movie serves as the seed for recommendations.
